      "content": "The error message you're facing indicates that PowerShell's execution policy is preventing the `yarn` script from running because it is not digitally signed. Here are steps you can follow to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Execution Policy**: First, you should check the current execution policy setting to understand what restrictions are in place. You can do this by running the following command in a PowerShell terminal:\n\n   ```sh\n   Get-ExecutionPolicy\n   ```\n\n2. **Change Execution Policy**: If the execution policy is too restrictive, you can change it. To allow the script to run, you can set the execution policy to `RemoteSigned`. This setting will allow scripts created on your local machine to run but require that scripts downloaded from the internet have a valid digital signature:\n\n   ```sh\n   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\n   ```\n\n   This command changes the execution policy for the current user only, which is safer than changing it globally.\n\n3. **Run PowerShell as Administrator**: Make sure you open PowerShell with administrative privileges when changing the execution policy.\n\n4. **Try Running Yarn Again**: Once you've changed the execution policy, try running the `yarn` command again.\n\n5. **Security Considerations**: Be cautious when changing execution policies. Revert to the previous policy if necessary, especially in environments where security is a concern.\n\nIf the issue persists or you encounter any errors, please inform me, and we can explore additional troubleshooting steps."

The SDK is installed but not added to the system `PATH`.\n3. There's a misconfiguration in your environment.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify .NET SDK Installation**:\n   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run the command: \n     ```sh\n     dotnet --list-sdks\n     ```\n   - If this command lists available SDKs, then they're installed. If not, proceed to the next step.\n\n2. **Install .NET SDK**:\n   - Visit the [.NET SDK download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) and download the latest version appropriate for your operating system.\n   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the page.\n\n3. **Check PATH Environment Variable**:\n   - Ensure that the path to your .NET SDK installation is added to your environment's `PATH` variable.\n   - For Windows, you can do this by searching for \"Environment Variables\" in the Control Panel, editing the `Path` variable, and adding the path to the .NET SDK (commonly something like `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet`).\n\n4. **Verify Installation**:\n   - After installing, reopen your terminal or command prompt, and run `dotnet --version` to ensure it's correctly installed and configured.\n\n5. **Restart the Terminal**:\n   - Sometimes a simple restart of your command line interface is needed for the `PATH` changes to take effect.\n\nTry executing your `dotnet run` command again after completing these steps. If you encounter further issues, please let me know!"

      "content": "The line of code you're referencing is a common pattern in JavaScript, particularly in the context of classes or functions where the `this` keyword is used. Here's a breakdown of what this line does:\n\n1. **Context Binding**: The line `this.navigateToSummaries = this.navigateToSummariesFn.bind(this);` is used to explicitly bind the `this` context of the `navigateToSummariesFn` function to the current instance of the object.\n\n2. **Purpose**: This ensures that whenever `navigateToSummaries` is called, the `this` inside `navigateToSummariesFn` will refer to the current instance of the object, not the context in which the function is executed. This is particularly important in JavaScript where `this` can vary based on how functions are called (e.g., as a callback).\n\n3. **Usage Scenario**: This construct is commonly used in scenarios such as:\n   - React class components where event handlers might otherwise lose the context of the instance.\n   - Event listeners where functions need to access instance-specific data.\n   - Any situation where passing methods around without losing their intended context is necessary.\n\n4. **Bind Method**: The `Function.prototype.bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.\n\nHere's a brief example to illustrate:\n\n```javascript\nclass Example {\n  constructor() {\n    this.name = 'Example';\n    this.showName = this.showNameFn.bind(this); // Ensure 'this' inside showNameFn points to the instance\n  }\n\n  showNameFn() {\n    console.log(this.name);\n  }\n}\n\nconst example = new Example();\nconst show = example.showName;\nshow(); // Logs: Example\n```\n\nIn this example, without the binding, calling `show()` might result in `undefined` as `this.name`, depending on how `show()` is called. Binding ensures `this` refers to the `example` instance."
