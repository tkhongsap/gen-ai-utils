### Application of Knowledgebase Information
The knowledgebase provides a structured method for adding roles and permissions in the OTC Sale system. The following steps are outlined:
1. **Identify Role ID**: Use the command `select * from TB_OTC_Role;` to find the Role ID of the desired role.
2. **Identify Company ID**: Use the command `select * from TB_OTC_Company;` to find the Company ID for the company you want to add the role to.
3. **Check User Existence**: Verify if the user exists in the system with `select * from TB_OTC_User where EmployeeId = '70090572';` (replace with the actual Employee ID).
4. **Add User if Not Found**: If the user does not exist, add them using:
   ```sql
   Declare @Employee_Ids NVARCHAR(MAX)   
   Set @Employee_Ids = '70090572'  // Change according to user 
   EXEC [USP_AddUser_With_EmployeeId_To_OTCSale] @Employee_Ids;
   ```
5. **Assign Role to User**: If the user exists, assign the role using:
   ```sql
   Declare @EmployeeId NVARCHAR(10) = N'70090572';  // Change according to user 
   Declare @CompanyId NVARCHAR(20) = N'2';  // Change according to company 
   Declare @RoleId NVARCHAR(20) = N'15';  // Change according to role 
   EXEC [dbo].[USP_AddPermission_OTCSale] @EmployeeId, @CompanyId, @RoleId;
   ```
6. **Verify Role Assignment**: Finally, check if the role has been assigned correctly:
   ```sql
   EXEC [USP_Check_User_In_OTCSale] @Company, '70090572'; // Change according to user
   ```

### Conclusion and Suggested Resolution
To resolve the issue of adding role and permissions for the OTC Sale system, follow the structured steps provided in the knowledgebase. Ensure to replace the placeholder values with actual data relevant to the user and company. This approach will facilitate a smooth update of roles and permissions, allowing users to have the necessary access to perform their tasks efficiently.
