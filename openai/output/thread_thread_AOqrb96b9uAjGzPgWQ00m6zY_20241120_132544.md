Content: ### Summary of the Case Incident
The issue reported is that a cancellation sale (‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å) is not being reflected in the SAP system. This typically indicates that there may be a problem with the status or the data associated with the cancellation in the relevant database.

### References Used
1. "‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å ‡∏™‡∏ñ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏∞‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤ SAP" - Solution steps related to checking the cancellation status and updating necessary fields in the database„Äê4:1‚Ä†source„Äë.

### Explanation of the Knowledgebase Information
The knowledgebase provides a detailed procedure for handling cases where a cancellation sale does not update in SAP. The steps include:
1. **Check the `CancelStatus` Field**: Verify if this field in the `TB_OTC_PurchaseOrders` table is set to `CancelComplete`. If it is, proceed to the next step.
2. **Check the `FIDoc` Field**: Ensure that this field has a value. If it does, continue to the next step.
3. **Check the `CancelFIDoc` Field**: If `CancelStatus` is `CancelComplete` but `CancelFIDoc` is empty, check the cancellation status in SAP to determine if it has been processed correctly.
4. **Update Fields for SAP Retry**: If necessary, update the `SapError` to 'CancelFI' and `SapTransactionStatus` to 2, then initiate a SAP retry process.

These steps are crucial for ensuring that the cancellation is processed correctly in both the database and SAP.

### Suggested Resolution
To resolve the issue of the cancellation sale not entering SAP, follow these steps:
1. Access the `OTCSales` database and navigate to the `TB_OTC_PurchaseOrders` table.
2. Check the `CancelStatus` field:
   - If it is not `CancelComplete`, the cancellation has not been finalized.
3. Check the `FIDoc` field:
   - If it is empty, this may indicate that the document has not been generated or processed.
4. Check the `CancelFIDoc` field:
   - If this field is empty while `CancelStatus` is `CancelComplete`, verify the cancellation status in the SAP system.
5. If all checks are satisfactory but the issue persists, update the relevant fields:
   - Set `SapError` to 'CancelFI' and `SapTransactionStatus` to 2.
6. Initiate a SAP retry process and wait for approximately 10 minutes for the job to complete.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and ensure that the cancellation sale is reflected in the SAP system. If further issues arise, additional investigation into the SAP logs may be necessary to diagnose any underlying problems.[0m

   ```sql
   DECLARE @Employee_Ids NVARCHAR(MAX);
   SET @Employee_Ids = '70090572'; // Change according to the user
   PRINT @Employee_Ids;
   EXEC [USP_AddUser_With_EmployeeId_To_OTCSale] @Employee_Ids;
   ```

6. **Assign Role to the User**:
   - Use this stored procedure to assign the role to the user:
   ```sql
   DECLARE @EmployeeId NVARCHAR(10) = N'70090572'; // Change according to the user
   DECLARE @CompanyId NVARCHAR(20) = N'2'; // Change according to the company
   DECLARE @RoleId NVARCHAR(20) = N'15'; // Change according to the role
   EXEC [dbo].[USP_AddPermission_OTCSale] @EmployeeId, @CompanyId, @RoleId;
   ```

7. **Verify Role Assignment**:
   - Run this query to ensure the role has been successfully assigned:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM TB_OTC_UserRoleCompany WHERE UserId = 341 AND CompanyId IN (16); 
   ```
   - Adjust the `UserId` and `CompanyId` as necessary to verify the correct assignment.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully add roles and permissions for users in the OTC Sale system. If you encounter any issues, make sure to check for typos in the Employee ID, Company ID, or Role ID, and ensure that the stored procedures are executed correctly. If needed, consult with your database administrator for further assistance.[0m

Content: To address the issue of incorrect stock in your system, let's go through a systematic approach to diagnose and resolve the problem. This will involve checking the relevant database tables and ensuring that the stock levels are accurately reflected.

### Steps to Resolve Incorrect Stock Issue

1. **Verify Document Information**:
   - Ensure that the document related to the stock transaction is correctly recorded in your system. Use the `LEDocumentNumber` to locate the document in the database.

2. **Check Quantity Fields**:
   - Access the `ItemInventory` collection in the `OTCInterface` database.
   - Execute the following SQL query to compare the recorded quantities with expected values:
   ```sql
   SELECT LEDocumentNumber, QuantityRemaining, QuantityApprovedRemaining, AmountRemaining, VatRemaining, DiscountRemaining
   FROM ItemInventory
   WHERE LEDocumentNumber = 'your_document_number';  -- Replace with actual document number
   ```
   - Review the `QuantityRemaining`, `QuantityApprovedRemaining`, `AmountRemaining`, `VatRemaining`, and `DiscountRemaining` fields to ensure they match the expected stock levels.

3. **Update Fields if Necessary**:
   - If discrepancies are found, update the fields in both the LE system and AfterSale system to correct the quantities. Use the following SQL update command as a guideline:
   ```sql
   UPDATE ItemInventory
   SET QuantityRemaining = correct_value,  -- Replace with correct value
       QuantityApprovedRemaining = correct_value,  -- Replace with correct value
       AmountRemaining = correct_value,  -- Replace with correct value
       VatRemaining = correct_value,  -- Replace with correct value
       DiscountRemaining = correct_value  -- Replace with correct value
   WHERE LEDocumentNumber = 'your_document_number';  -- Replace with actual document number
   ```

4. **Verify Changes**:
   - After making the updates, run the initial SELECT query again to verify that the changes are correctly reflected in the system.

5. **Check for System Synchronization**:
   - Ensure that both the LE system and any other connected systems (like AfterSale) are synchronized. Look for any pending transactions or errors in the system logs that might indicate synchronization issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and correct the incorrect stock levels in your system. If the problem persists, consider consulting with your IT team to investigate any potential system integration issues or bugs that might be affecting stock calculations.[0m
