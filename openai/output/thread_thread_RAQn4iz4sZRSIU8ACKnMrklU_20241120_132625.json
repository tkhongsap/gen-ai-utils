      "content": "### Summary of the Case Incident\nThe user is experiencing issues with a Transport Order (TO) that is not updating properly in the system.\n\n### References Used\n1. **TO cancel ไม่ได้ ในระบบ LE** - discusses the potential reasons and checks for issues related to Transport Orders not updating or being canceled.\n2. **LE ต้องไม่มีค้างขน แต่หน้าเว็บแสดงค้างขนผิด** - provides guidance on how to check and update database fields related to TOs.\n\n### Application of Knowledgebase Information\nFrom the knowledgebase, the following steps can be taken to troubleshoot and resolve the issue of the TO not updating:\n\n1. **Check Web Socket Connection**: Ensure that the web application can connect to the web socket. This can be done by pressing F12 to open the developer tools, navigating to the Network tab, filtering for \"ws\", and checking that the status is 101 (indicating a successful connection).\n\n2. **Verify SAP Cancellation**: If the issue involves canceling a TO, check whether the cancellation was successful in the SAP system. If it was, the data in the LE database (specifically in the `DocumentInfo` collection) should reflect this. The field `Transports.DO.State` should show the status as `SAPCanceled`.\n\n3. **Update Database Fields**: If the cancellation was successful but the TO is still not updating, you may need to manually update the relevant fields in the database. For example, ensure that the fields related to remaining quantities and amounts are correctly set to zero if applicable.\n\n### Conclusion and Suggested Resolution\nTo resolve the issue of the TO not updating:\n1. Verify that the web application can connect to the web socket.\n2. Check the status of the TO in the SAP system and ensure that it reflects the correct cancellation state.\n3. If necessary, manually update the relevant fields in the `DocumentInfo` collection to ensure that they reflect the correct status.\n\nIf the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to your technical team for further assistance with database updates or system configurations."

This can be done using the following SQL query:\n   ```sql\n   use RPT_Sales_OR;\n   select * from RPT_OTC_Transport_Detail with(nolock) Where LEDocumentNumber = 'your_document_number';\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify DOId**: After running the query, check if the DOId matches the one provided. If there is a discrepancy, you may need to delete the incorrect entry and reprocess the DO:\n   ```sql\n   delete from RPT_OTC_Transport_Detail Where TransportOrders_TransportOrderId = 'your_transport_order_id';\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Status in TOMS**: Ensure that the status in TOMS is accurate. If the status is showing as \"All Assigned,\" it may indicate that the data needs to be re-produced or refreshed in the system:\n   - Check the status using:\n   ```sql\n   select * from TB_FTD_LE_Order_TransportOrders with(nolock) Where LEDocumentNumber = 'your_document_number';\n   ```\n\n4. **Reproduce the DO**: If the DO is not showing up correctly, you may need to reproduce the document in the system. Ensure that the state of the document in the MongoDB collection `DocumentInfo` is set to `TOComplete` before reproducing it.\n\n### Conclusion and Suggested Resolution\nTo resolve the issue with the DO number:\n1. Execute the SQL queries provided to check the status and details of the DO.\n2. Verify that the DOId is correct and matches the expected values.\n3. If discrepancies are found, delete the incorrect entries and reprocess the DO.\n4. If necessary, reproduce the DO in the system ensuring the document state is correct.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, consider escalating the matter to your technical team for further investigation."

If it does not match, it indicates that there is an issue with the DO generation.\n\n3. **Update Inventory Fields**: If discrepancies are found in the quantities or amounts associated with the DO, you may need to update the relevant fields in the `ItemInventory` collection.

Execute the SQL query to check the transport order details and verify the `DOId`.\n2. If discrepancies are found, update the relevant fields in the `ItemInventory` collection as needed.\n3.
