To assist you effectively, I'll need more specifics about your requirements:\n\n1. **Database Details**: Which database are you using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)?\n2. **File Format**: What format is the input file in (e.g., CSV, JSON, plain text)?\n3. **Table Structure**: What is the schema of the table you want to insert data into (including the table name and column names)?\n4. **Script Language**: Are you looking for a specific programming language (e.g., Python, Bash)?\n\nWith this information, I can provide you with a tailored script. If you have a sample file you'd like to work with, feel free to upload it as well."
