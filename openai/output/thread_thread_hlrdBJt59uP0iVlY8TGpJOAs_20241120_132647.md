Content: Business Requirements Document for MDM Integration with genAI
1. Business Need

The company presently utilizes the Master Data Management (MDM) system for material management. To enhance this system's data quality and management effectiveness, the business seeks to integrate genAI, an artificial intelligence software, for pre-checking and verifying duplicate data prior to user-submitted incidents.

2. SMART Objectives
Specific: Efficiently eliminate duplicate data entries in the MDM system by integrating genAI for pre-checking incidents.
Measurable: The success of this solution could be evaluated based on a reduction in the number of duplicate incidents by 80% within 6 months from the system deployment.
Achievable: The technology team should ensure that integration is possible and improve the system to identify duplicates while checking the data.
Relevant: This project aligns with our goal of enhancing data accuracy and effectiveness of materials management systems.
Time-bound: Aim to have the integrated system fully operational by the end of Q2 2022.
3. Key Stakeholders and Their Roles
Business Analyst: To define and articulate the business requirements and objectives for the AI integration.
IT Department: To ensure the successful integration of genAI with the MDM system.
User Groups: To test and utilize the enhanced features of the system, bearing the end-users of the MDM system in mind.
Data Management Team: To manage and oversee data quality and performance.
4. Functional Requirements
The system should incorporate genAI to automatically check for duplicate entries during incident submission.
The system should cross-verify the stock data with the genAI's decision-making capabilities.
The system should facilitate comprehensive information checks to ensure data accuracy.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: The integrated system should swiftly process and verify data efficiently.
Security: The system should contain robust data protection measures to safeguard sensitive information from breaches.
Scalability: The enhanced MDM system should accommodate more data and more functions in the future.
6. Constraints and Assumptions
The MDM system can integrate seamlessly with genAI.
Sufficient financial and human resources will support the project.
The upgraded system may require users to undergo training to understand the improved tools and functionalities.
7. Success Criteria
Reduction of duplicate data entries by 80% within 6 months of full system deployment.
Positive feedback from users regarding the data accuracy and system performance.
Maintain expected system security and data protection levels.  How can I start ?[0m

Content: To initiate the process of integrating genAI with your Master Data Management (MDM) system, you can follow a structured approach based on the Business Requirements Document (BRD) you've provided. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

### 1. Project Planning
- **Kick-off Meeting**: Organize a meeting with all key stakeholders to discuss the project scope, objectives, and timelines.
- **Define Project Scope**: Clearly outline what is included in the integration project and what is not (in-scope vs out-of-scope).

### 2. Assemble Your Team
- **Determine Roles**: Confirm that all key stakeholders (Business Analyst, IT Department, User Groups, Data Management Team) understand their roles.
- **Assign Leads for Each Role**: Appoint leads for each stakeholder group to facilitate communication and decision-making.

### 3. Requirements Gathering
- **Meet with Stakeholders**: Conduct workshops or interviews to gather detailed requirements about the existing MDM system workflows and how genAI can enhance them.
- **Documentation**: Update your BRD with any new information gathered during these discussions.

### 4. Technical Feasibility Study
- **Consult with the IT Department**: Assess the technical compatibility of the current MDM system with genAI.
- **Explore Integration Options**: Identify possible methods for integration (API, middleware, etc.) and any required changes to the MDM system.

### 5. Prototype Development
- **Rapid Prototyping**: If possible, develop a prototype or proof of concept (PoC) of the genAI integration to gather initial feedback.
- **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Refine your prototype based on feedback from users and stakeholders.

### 6. Implementation Plan
- **Create a Detailed Project Plan**: Document all phases of the project, including timelines, milestones, and deliverables.
- **Risk Management**: Identify potential risks and develop a mitigation plan.

### 7. User Training and Change Management
- **Training Programs**: Develop training sessions for users to familiarize them with the new functionalities of the system.
- **Change Management**: Ensure there is a strategy in place to manage user expectations and feedback post-launch.

### 8. Testing
- **Conduct Testing Phases**: Perform unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure all functionalities are working as expected.
- **Success Metrics**: Measure the system's performance against your SMART objectives, focusing on the reduction in duplicate data entries.

### 9. Deployment
- **Go-Live**: Plan a go-live strategy to transition from the old system to the enhanced MDM system.
- **Monitoring**: After deployment, monitor the system for issues and gather user feedback for further improvements.

### 10. Post-Implementation Review
- **Performance Evaluation**: Review against success criteria indicated in the BRD.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Set a plan for regular updates and maintenance of the system to adapt to future needs.

### Additional Considerations
- **Documentation**: Keep comprehensive documentation at every phase, including design specifications, user guides, and training materials.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Maintain regular communication with stakeholders throughout the project to ensure alignment with business goals.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage the integration of genAI into your MDM system, ensuring improved data quality and management effectiveness.[0m
