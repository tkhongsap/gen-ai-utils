      "content": "### Summary of the Case Incident\nThe issue reported is that a cancellation sale (ขายยกเลิก) is not being reflected in the SAP system. This typically indicates that there may be a problem with the status or the data associated with the cancellation in the relevant database.\n\n### References Used\n1. \"ขายยกเลิก สถานะไม่เข้า SAP\" - Solution steps related to checking the cancellation status and updating necessary fields in the database【4:1†source】.\n\n### Explanation of the Knowledgebase Information\nThe knowledgebase provides a detailed procedure for handling cases where a cancellation sale does not update in SAP. The steps include:\n1. **Check the `CancelStatus` Field**: Verify if this field in the `TB_OTC_PurchaseOrders` table is set to `CancelComplete`. If it is, proceed to the next step.\n2. **Check the `FIDoc` Field**: Ensure that this field has a value. If it does, continue to the next step.\n3. **Check the `CancelFIDoc` Field**: If `CancelStatus` is `CancelComplete` but `CancelFIDoc` is empty, check the cancellation status in SAP to determine if it has been processed correctly.\n4. **Update Fields for SAP Retry**: If necessary, update the `SapError` to 'CancelFI' and `SapTransactionStatus` to 2, then initiate a SAP retry process.\n\nThese steps are crucial for ensuring that the cancellation is processed correctly in both the database and SAP.\n\n### Suggested Resolution\nTo resolve the issue of the cancellation sale not entering SAP, follow these steps:\n1. Access the `OTCSales` database and navigate to the `TB_OTC_PurchaseOrders` table.\n2. Check the `CancelStatus` field:\n   - If it is not `CancelComplete`, the cancellation has not been finalized.\n3. Check the `FIDoc` field:\n   - If it is empty, this may indicate that the document has not been generated or processed.\n4. Check the `CancelFIDoc` field:\n   - If this field is empty while `CancelStatus` is `CancelComplete`, verify the cancellation status in the SAP system.\n5. If all checks are satisfactory but the issue persists, update the relevant fields:\n   - Set `SapError` to 'CancelFI' and `SapTransactionStatus` to 2.\n6. Initiate a SAP retry process and wait for approximately 10 minutes for the job to complete.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and ensure that the cancellation sale is reflected in the SAP system. If further issues arise, additional investigation into the SAP logs may be necessary to diagnose any underlying problems."

      "content": "To address the issue of incorrect stock in your system, let's go through a systematic approach to diagnose and resolve the problem. This will involve checking the relevant database tables and ensuring that the stock levels are accurately reflected.\n\n### Steps to Resolve Incorrect Stock Issue\n\n1. **Verify Document Information**:\n   - Ensure that the document related to the stock transaction is correctly recorded in your system. Use the `LEDocumentNumber` to locate the document in the database.\n\n2. **Check Quantity Fields**:\n   - Access the `ItemInventory` collection in the `OTCInterface` database.\n   - Execute the following SQL query to compare the recorded quantities with expected values:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT LEDocumentNumber, QuantityRemaining, QuantityApprovedRemaining, AmountRemaining, VatRemaining, DiscountRemaining\n   FROM ItemInventory\n   WHERE LEDocumentNumber = 'your_document_number';  -- Replace with actual document number\n   ```\n   - Review the `QuantityRemaining`, `QuantityApprovedRemaining`, `AmountRemaining`, `VatRemaining`, and `DiscountRemaining` fields to ensure they match the expected stock levels.\n\n3. **Update Fields if Necessary**:\n   - If discrepancies are found, update the fields in both the LE system and AfterSale system to correct the quantities. Use the following SQL update command as a guideline:\n   ```sql\n   UPDATE ItemInventory\n   SET QuantityRemaining = correct_value,  -- Replace with correct value\n       QuantityApprovedRemaining = correct_value,  -- Replace with correct value\n       AmountRemaining = correct_value,  -- Replace with correct value\n       VatRemaining = correct_value,  -- Replace with correct value\n       DiscountRemaining = correct_value  -- Replace with correct value\n   WHERE LEDocumentNumber = 'your_document_number';  -- Replace with actual document number\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Changes**:\n   - After making the updates, run the initial SELECT query again to verify that the changes are correctly reflected in the system.\n\n5. **Check for System Synchronization**:\n   - Ensure that both the LE system and any other connected systems (like AfterSale) are synchronized. Look for any pending transactions or errors in the system logs that might indicate synchronization issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and correct the incorrect stock levels in your system. If the problem persists, consider consulting with your IT team to investigate any potential system integration issues or bugs that might be affecting stock calculations."
