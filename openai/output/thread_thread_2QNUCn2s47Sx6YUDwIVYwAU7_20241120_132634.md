### 2. Know Your Objectives
- **Understand the CEO‚Äôs Vision:** Before your meeting, familiarize yourself with the company‚Äôs goals and the CEO‚Äôs vision for the future. This will help you align your introduction with company objectives.

Prepare insightful questions that show your commitment to the company and your role. Examples include:

- "How do you envision the procurement function contributing more to our EPC projects?"

- **Dress Appropriately:** Ensure your attire is professional, aligning with the company's culture.
- **Punctuality:** Arrive on time to set a positive tone for your first day.

### 6. Be Open to Dialogue
