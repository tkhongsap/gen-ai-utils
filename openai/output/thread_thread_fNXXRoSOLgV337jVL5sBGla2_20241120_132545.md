Content: The error message you're facing indicates that PowerShell's execution policy is preventing the `yarn` script from running because it is not digitally signed. Here are steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. **Check Execution Policy**: First, you should check the current execution policy setting to understand what restrictions are in place. You can do this by running the following command in a PowerShell terminal:

   ```sh
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```

2. **Change Execution Policy**: If the execution policy is too restrictive, you can change it. To allow the script to run, you can set the execution policy to `RemoteSigned`. This setting will allow scripts created on your local machine to run but require that scripts downloaded from the internet have a valid digital signature:

   ```sh
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

   This command changes the execution policy for the current user only, which is safer than changing it globally.

3. **Run PowerShell as Administrator**: Make sure you open PowerShell with administrative privileges when changing the execution policy.

4. **Try Running Yarn Again**: Once you've changed the execution policy, try running the `yarn` command again.

5. **Security Considerations**: Be cautious when changing execution policies. Revert to the previous policy if necessary, especially in environments where security is a concern.

If the issue persists or you encounter any errors, please inform me, and we can explore additional troubleshooting steps.[0m

The command could not be loaded, possibly because:
  * You intended to execute a .NET application:
      The application 'run' does not exist.
  * You intended to execute a .NET SDK command:
      No .NET SDKs were found.

Content: The error message indicates that the `.NET SDK` is not installed or not recognized in your environment. This can occur if:

1. The .NET SDK isn't installed on your machine.
2. The SDK is installed but not added to the system `PATH`.
3. There's a misconfiguration in your environment.

Here's how you can resolve this issue:

1. **Verify .NET SDK Installation**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run the command: 
     ```sh
     dotnet --list-sdks
     ```
   - If this command lists available SDKs, then they're installed. If not, proceed to the next step.

2. **Install .NET SDK**:
   - Visit the [.NET SDK download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) and download the latest version appropriate for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the page.

3. **Check PATH Environment Variable**:
   - Ensure that the path to your .NET SDK installation is added to your environment's `PATH` variable.
   - For Windows, you can do this by searching for "Environment Variables" in the Control Panel, editing the `Path` variable, and adding the path to the .NET SDK (commonly something like `C:\Program Files\dotnet`).

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - After installing, reopen your terminal or command prompt, and run `dotnet --version` to ensure it's correctly installed and configured.

5. **Restart the Terminal**:
   - Sometimes a simple restart of your command line interface is needed for the `PATH` changes to take effect.

Try executing your `dotnet run` command again after completing these steps. If you encounter further issues, please let me know![0m

what is this code line mean[0m

Content: The line of code you're referencing is a common pattern in JavaScript, particularly in the context of classes or functions where the `this` keyword is used. Here's a breakdown of what this line does:

1. **Context Binding**: The line `this.navigateToSummaries = this.navigateToSummariesFn.bind(this);` is used to explicitly bind the `this` context of the `navigateToSummariesFn` function to the current instance of the object.

2. **Purpose**: This ensures that whenever `navigateToSummaries` is called, the `this` inside `navigateToSummariesFn` will refer to the current instance of the object, not the context in which the function is executed. This is particularly important in JavaScript where `this` can vary based on how functions are called (e.g., as a callback).

3. **Usage Scenario**: This construct is commonly used in scenarios such as:
   - React class components where event handlers might otherwise lose the context of the instance.
   - Event listeners where functions need to access instance-specific data.
   - Any situation where passing methods around without losing their intended context is necessary.

4. **Bind Method**: The `Function.prototype.bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

Here's a brief example to illustrate:

```javascript
class Example {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'Example';
    this.showName = this.showNameFn.bind(this); // Ensure 'this' inside showNameFn points to the instance
  }

  showNameFn() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}

const example = new Example();
const show = example.showName;
show(); // Logs: Example
```

In this example, without the binding, calling `show()` might result in `undefined` as `this.name`, depending on how `show()` is called. Binding ensures `this` refers to the `example` instance.[0m
