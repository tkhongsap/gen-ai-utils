      "content": "### Summary of the Case Incident\nYou are seeking guidance on how to add or modify roles and permissions within the OTC Sale system.\n\n### References Used\nI searched for relevant articles in the provided knowledgebase but did not find specific information directly addressing the process of adding roles and permissions in the OTC Sale system.\n\n### Application of Knowledgebase Information\nWhile the knowledgebase contains various incidents related to the OTC Sale system, none explicitly outline the steps for managing roles and permissions. This indicates that the information might be either missing or not detailed in the documents provided.\n\n### Suggested Resolution\nSince there is no direct information available in the knowledgebase regarding adding roles and permissions in the OTC Sale system, I recommend the following general steps:\n\n1. **Access the Admin Panel**: Log into the system with an administrator account that has the necessary privileges to manage roles and permissions.\n   \n2. **Navigate to User Management**: Look for a section labeled \"User Management\" or \"Roles and Permissions\" within the admin panel.\n\n3. **Create or Modify Roles**: If you need to create a new role, there should be an option to add a new role. If modifying an existing role, select the role you wish to edit.\n\n4. **Assign Permissions**: Once in the role settings, you can assign specific permissions based on the needs of the role. This usually involves checking boxes next to the permissions you want to grant.\n\n5. **Save Changes**: Ensure to save any changes made to roles and permissions.\n\n6. **Testing**: After making changes, it’s a good practice to test the new roles and permissions by logging in as a user with the modified role to ensure they have the correct access.\n\nIf you require more detailed or specific instructions, please consult your internal documentation or reach out to your system administrator for assistance."
