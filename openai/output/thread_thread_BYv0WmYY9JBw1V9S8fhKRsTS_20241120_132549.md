5. **Integration and Automation**: Integrate the AI tool with your existing systems to automate the process. This might involve setting up APIs or using third-party integrations that link your meeting applications to the AI model. 

6. **Testing and Iteration**: Test the summarization capabilities of the AI by running it through diverse meeting scenarios. Check for accuracy, relevancy, and comprehensiveness, then adjust parameters as necessary.

7. **Deployment**: Once satisfied with the results, deploy the solution across your organization. Train employees on how to use it effectively, including uploading meetings and accessing summaries and minutes.

8. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Continuously monitor the system's outputs for quality and efficiency. Gather user feedback and make improvements as needed.

9. **Documentation**: Keep detailed documentation for processes, configurations, and system operations, ensuring it's accessible to all stakeholders for future reference and maintenance.
