Press and hold the power button for about 10-15 seconds. This should force the laptop to shut down.\n  2. If the laptop is still unresponsive, check if there are any applications preventing shutdown. You can do this by closing all programs manually.\n  3. Ensure that no external devices are connected that might interfere with the shutdown process.\n  4. If the issue persists, it may be related to the operating system settings or hardware issues. Consider seeking technical support for further diagnosis."
