Dear P Yui,

I hope this message finds you well.

Following my review of the SSC PUR group data in the last version, I have combined and validated it with the SAP transaction data. However, I noticed that some groups are missing. 

Could you please assist in updating the data and providing feedback by November 10th? We need this information for the Thai Bev spending report to help us monitor and track the PUR group more effectively.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Content: To calculate the percentage of utilization from Purchase Requisition (PR) to Purchase Order (PO), you can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Utilization Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{PR item quantity}}{\text{PO item quantity}} \right) \times 100
\]

In your case, you have:

- PR item = 607
- PO item = 759

Now, let's plug in the values and compute the utilization percentage:

\[
\text{Utilization Percentage} = \left( \frac{607}{759} \right) \times 100
\]

Now, letâ€™s calculate this.[0m
